Technologies Used

HTML5: Structures the content of all pages.
CSS: Styles the layout, using Bootstrap for responsiveness (css/styles.css).
JavaScript: Powers interactivity (e.g., burger builder, recipe filtering, form submissions)(js/scripts.js).
External Libraries:
Map library (using my own personal mymaps) for City_Burgers.html.
Chart library (e.g., Chart.js) for the bar chart in City_Burgers.html.


No Backend: The website is static, with no server-side processing.





Developers:

Map and Chart: The interactive map and chart in City_Burgers.html rely on external libraries (Chart.js and mymaps (which I created)). 
Favourites Functionality: The favourites system (favourites.html, recipe_cards.html) uses local storage. 
Form Submission: The submission form in Submit.html is static and doesnt not go anywhere but will throw and alert/pop-up like a normal commercial website.
